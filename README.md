#Game Engines 2 Assignment

###Overview
This was a project I worked on as part of a game engines module in fourth year of my computer science degree.
The guidelines of the project were to implement autonomous steering behaviours adopted from source:

Instead of using C++, I wanted to create the behviours using JavaScript and the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library.

A demo can be found [here](http://antohayden.com/steeringbehaviours)
